# 👋 Hi, I'm Gordon Dewis aka @KeeperOfMaps

During the day, I work for Statistics Canada as an analyst and survey manager,
however none of what I'm doing here is related to that. Outside of work, I'm  involved with
a citizen science organization called [CosmoQuest](https://github.com/CosmoQuestX) as part of the editorial team and 
one of their streamers on Twitch, and I'm also helping with their
citizen science software.
